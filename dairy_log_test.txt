		generator
			THe 24V batteries have run out of power and I turned off the generator
			We need to jump start them and then charge the batteries.
				I need to run the generator weekly or install a more permanent recharge solution for the site

		Tried to get centurion internet working
			The ethernet cable goes to a ubiquiti loco m5 radio link that Centurion Sebastion Configured
				It does nto seem to provide an internet link
			We had some weird issues with the fiber to ethernet converter.\

		ToDO
			Finish EV chargers integration so we can actually limit the chargers if the Battery SOC gets too low.
			Fix generator 24V battery
			Check Centurion internet connection
